# Axls_Bot
a python telegram bot which will have lots of cool features!

you can find it in telegram by searching 'Axls_Bot' in your contact list or in a grop via add members

the greatest Features for now are:
 - the poll system with inline buttons
 - the /funfact command which returns a random fact from http://www.randomfunfacts.com/

Note:
 - in /TelegramBot/Messages.py there are two free spaces for the bot token and a chat id
 - the drawing library PIL is required to draw a pie chart as poll summary
   (available here: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/tree/master/PIL)
 
feel free to ask me about new features :)

best regards,
Symbroson
